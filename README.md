## ðŸ“Œ Features  

- **Self-Driving Logic:** A minimal neural network that allows the car to navigate autonomously.  
- **No Libraries Required:** Pure JavaScript implementation for learning and simplicity.

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works  

1. **Sensors:** The car has virtual sensors detecting distances to obstacles.  
2. **Neural Network:** A lightweight neural network processes sensor inputs and decides steering actions.
